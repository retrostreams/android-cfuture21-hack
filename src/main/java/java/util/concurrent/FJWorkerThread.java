     * ForkJoinWorkerThreads are managed by ForkJoinPools and perform
     * ForkJoinTasks. For explanation, see the internal documentation
     * of class FJPool.
     *
     * This class just maintains links to its pool and WorkQueue.  The
     * pool field is set immediately upon construction, but the
     * workQueue field is not set until a call to registerWorker
     * completes. This leads to a visibility race, that is tolerated
     * by requiring that the workQueue field is only accessed by the
     * owning thread.
     *
     * Support for (non-public) subclass InnocuousForkJoinWorkerThread
     * requires that we break quite a lot of encapsulation (via helper
     * methods in ThreadLocalRandom) both here and in the subclass to
     * access and set Thread fields.
